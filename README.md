# campus-flask-slideshow
This project is a web-based image slideshow application designed for campus-wide accessibility. Built using Flask, it allows users on the same network to view an automatically rotating image slideshow, with real-time synchronization across devices. The application is lightweight, responsive, and easy to set up, making it ideal for events.
